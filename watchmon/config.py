# `alerts=False` keeps them out of both the ceiling rule and steal screening.
#
# `brands=()` means the query is a category, swept once instead of per brand.
# Searches are price-ascending, so each sweep samples the same cheap end of a
# catalogue every day — which is what a median needs. Depth is deliberately
# shallow (max_pages) because history wants the same products daily, not broad
# coverage of a category nobody is alerted about.

# Breadth beats depth. A query exhausts after a handful of pages (keyboard
# returned 40 items, laptop 86), so coverage grows by adding queries, not
# pages. Prices are bucketed by day, so each product only needs to be seen
# once a day — which is what makes rotation work: a slice per run, the whole
# catalogue across a day.
